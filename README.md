## About

**Concordia** is a [business-readable](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html), [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) requirements specification metalanguage inspired by [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin). Currently it supports [English](./docs/en/language.md) and [Portuguese](./docs/pt/language.md). New languages can be added easily.

**Concordia Compiler** generates and executes [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing) test cases and test scripts from documents written in *Concordia Language*. It uses [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and many other techniques in the process.

Both **test cases** and **test scripts** receive *test data* and *test oracles*. You don't have to produce them manually - they are inferred from your specification.

Concordia Compiler uses [plug-ins](docs/en/plugins.md) for transforming test cases (`.testcase` files) into test scripts, *i.e.* source code, and for setting the test environment up for you. Every **plug-in** can generate test scripts for a different programming language and testing framework, for **web**, **mobile**, or **desktop** applications.


### Why using it ?

1. Simple, flexible [syntax](docs/en/language.md).

2. Separate high-level, business language declarations from medium-low-level, computing language declarations, **improving the communication** between your team, customers, and other stakeholders. Thus, you can **use a same document** to discuss features with stakeholders, analysts, testers, and developers, and facilitate the adoption of [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)/[ATDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_test%E2%80%93driven_development)/[SbE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example).

3. Make **your specifications more useful**. Get automated functional tests from your specification easily and **drive your development covered by tests**.

4. **Add test automation to new or legacy applications** without having to write code.

5. Generate **relevant test cases and test scripts** in a few milliseconds. Get tests that adopt techniques such as [equivalence partitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_partitioning), [boundary value analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary-value_analysis), [combinatorial testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pairs_testing) (*n-wise*), and [random testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_testing) without having to think about (and invest your time in) them all.

6. **Reduce the need of writing negative scenarios** (those scenarios that handle incorrect or invalid input) by describing system rules of user interface elements. Concordia supports complex, dynamic system rules.

7. Create rules with data from **files or databases** and Concordia will use them for producing the test cases.

8.  **Track your specification** from the produced test cases and test scripts. They receive special line (code) comments that refer to the specification and the adopted testing techniques.

9.  **Add test cases without coding**. Write them with Concordia and let the compiler convert them into source code.

10.  Use a **plain text** requirements specification that is version control-friendly and can evolve with your application.


## Installation

Concordia Compiler works on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **MacOS**, and requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) version `8` or above. If you want to test *web-based* applications, you also need to install [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

After installing the dependencies, open the console/terminal to execute the installation command.

### 1. Global Installation

**Windows**
```bash
npm install -g concordialang
```

**Linux** or **MacOS**
```bash
sudo npm install -g concordialang
```

*Advanced tip*: [How to install globally with NPM on Linux or MacOS without sudo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md)

**Checking the installation**
```bash
concordia --version
```

üëâ Note that `concordia` is the command to be used from now on, which is different from `concordialang` (used to install).

### 2. Local Installation

Concordia Compiler can also be installed locally, inside your application's directory, and executed with [NPX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx). NPX is already included in NodeJS `8.2.0` or above.

**Windows**, **Linux** or **MacOS**

```bash
cd my-application
npm install concordialang
```

*However*, you will need to use `npx ` before *all* the Concordia commands. Example:
```bash
npx concordia --version
```

## Getting Started

Let's create a basic, "hello world"-like example.

> üëâ This example does _not_ cover test data generation, test oracle generation, feature combination, and many other things.

In order to run its tests, you will need an Internet connection and the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) web browser installed.

**Step 1: *Create a directory***

Create a directory named `search` and then access it using the terminal:

```bash
mkdir search
cd search
```

> üí¨ *Quick Tip*: If you are using Windows, you may create a empty folder using Windows Explorer, open it, and then type `cmd` in the address bar.

**Step 2: *Configure***

Execute the following command to guide the setup process:

```bash
concordia --init
```
üëâ On **Linux** or **MacOS** you may need to use `sudo` before the command, whether your **NodeJS' version is less than `8.2`** or you are using Concordia `0.x`.

You'll be asked about your preferences and they will be stored in a configuration file named `.concordiarc`. **LET ALL THE DEFAULT VALUES**, by typing <kbd>Enter</kbd> for all the questions.

Plug-ins will also be installed during the process. If you want to install them *manually*, please take a look at the [plugins page](./docs/en/plugins.md).

**Step 3: *Start the test server***

Test automation tools often use a test server to control a *web browser*, a *device emulator* or a *real device*. So, first you start a test server, then you run all the test scripts.

Since **a test server usually blocks** the current terminal/console, **open a new terminal/console**.

> üí¨ *Quick Tip*: If you are using Windows, you can start a new terminal from you current directory by running:
> ```bash
> start cmd .
> ```

Concordia Compiler facilitates to start a test server by giving you a parameter `--plugin-serve`. In the new terminal, run the following command:

```bash
concordia --plugin-serve
```

It is likely that your testing server remain open. To stop it later (not now, please), just type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.

**Step 4: *Create a feature***

Create the directory `features`, which is the place for feature files:

```bash
mkdir features
```

Now use your favorite (UTF-8) text editor to create a file named `search.feature`, inside the directory `features`, with the following content:

```gherkin
Feature: Search
  As a visitor
  I would like to search using keywords
  In order to find what I need

Scenario: Search returns the expected result
  Given that I am in the search screen
  When I enter with the search content
    and I choose the search option
  Then I see a result that matches the search content

  Variant: Search content on pressing Enter
    Given that I am on "https://google.com"
    When I type "concordialang.org" in <q>
      And I press "Enter"
    Then I see "npm"
```

Feature and Scenario are high-level, business-focused descriptions about the problem to solve. A Variant describes the expected interaction with the application's user interface in order to perform a Scenario. Thus, a Variant uses a more technological vocabulary.

> üëâ In Concordia, all the interactions with the application's user interface use first person singular ("I"). That "I" represents the actor that is interacting with the application (in the example above, a *visitor*).

**Step 5: *Execute***

In the `search` directory, just execute:
```bash
concordia
```

*Congratulations!*

Concordia Compiler will:
  - setup the testing environment;
  - generate a test case;
  - transform the test case into a test script;
  - execute the test script; and
  - report the test script result.

Your browser should open automatically during this process and the console will show the execution results.

**Some generated files:**

`features/search.testcase`, that will contain the produced test case:

```gherkin
# Generated with ‚ù§ by Concordia
#
# THIS IS A GENERATED FILE - MODIFICATIONS CAN BE LOST !

import "search.feature"

@generated
@scenario(1)
@variant(1)
Test case: Search content on pressing Enter - 1
  Given that I am on "https://google.com"
  When I type "concordialang.org" in <q>
    And I press "Enter"
  Then I see "npm"
```

In the example above, there is a Test Case generated from the Variant declared in `search.feature`. The `import` clause imports that file's content. The tag `@generated` indicates that the Test Case was produced automatically, while the tags `@scenario` and `@variant` refers to its Scenario and Variant by their positions (indexes).

`test/search.js`, that will contain the test script produced from `features/search.testcase` for the framework CodeceptJS with WebDriverIO:

```javascript
// Generated with ‚ù§ by Concordia
// source: search.testcase
//
// THIS IS A GENERATED FILE - MODIFICATIONS CAN BE LOST !

Feature("Search");

Scenario("Search returns the expected result | Search content on pressing Enter - 1", (I) => {
    I.amOnPage("https://google.com");
    I.fillField("q", "concordialang.org");
    I.pressKey("Enter");
    I.see("npm");
});
```

To generate and run the test again, just repeat the last command.
